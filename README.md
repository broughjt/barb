> quicker than me, I had misread equations in a way that had seemed

> faster; because of how his brain was set up, he couldn't read that
> in their faces. And he did not have the same desire to reach a
> distant goal. He was altogether self-centered and short-sighted. He
> wanted only to understand this one problem or equation chalked on

> convenient for the others around him. And he was willing to stand
> there asking questions about it through supper and past curfew."
